Pairwise Independence of JGAAP Linguistic Analysis Methods & Log Parser
==

This repository includes the Parser for JGAAP log files and the Pairwise Indepenence calculator that will determine the independence between all pairs of methods.

For determining pairwise independence between methods, call process() from PairwiseIndependence.java and supply it with a MultiLog.

To Make a MultiLog object, call new MultiLog("file/path/to/Directory/of/Logs");

If you have a directory of directories of logs, then you must pass the String file path, a string name of the Batch Z Test you are running, and boolean value: true. 


TODO
--
* Ensure that the errors in LogData.java and MultiLog.java are handled or thrown appropriately, so that mass batch testing, will continue to process after discarding problem files from the group.
* Nearly 100% sure there is no incomplete or Null TestData objects added to LogData. Just need a Professional's expertise on whether or not this needs special handleing.
* Refine Pairwise Independence Statistics
    + Decide on how to handle 100% success and failure files
* The Files read in do not read in ascending order, but rather some alpha-numeric method. An example order of reading: 1, 10, 11, 2, 20, 21, 3. Is this a problem?
* Fix TestData to store the numerical value of NGrams and other numeric information as actual number data.
